=== Handling errors ===

The result of any request against the transaction endpoint is streamed back to the client.
Therefore the server does not know whether the request will be successful or not when it sends the HTTP status
code.

Because of this, all requests against the transactional endpoint will return 200 or 201 status code, regardless
of whether statements were successfully executed. At the end of the response payload, the server includes a list
of errors that occurred while executing statements. If this list is empty, the request completed successfully.

If any errors occur while executing statements, the server will roll back the transaction.

In this example, we send the server an invalid statement to demonstrate error handling.

For more information on the status codes, see <<status-codes>>.
