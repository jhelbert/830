|Neo.ClientError.Request.Invalid |The client provided an invalid request. 
|Neo.ClientError.Request.InvalidFormat |The client provided a request that was missing required fields, or had values that are not allowed. 
|Neo.ClientError.Schema.ConstraintAlreadyExists |Unable to perform operation because it would clash with a pre-existing constraint.

|Neo.ClientError.Schema.ConstraintViolation |A constraint imposed by the database was violated. 
|Neo.ClientError.Schema.IllegalTokenName |A token name, such as a label, relationship type or property key, used is not valid. Tokens cannot be empty strings and cannot be null. 
|Neo.ClientError.Schema.IndexAlreadyExists |Unable to perform operation because it would clash with a pre-existing index. 
|Neo.ClientError.Schema.IndexBelongsToConstraint |A requested operation can not be performed on the specified index because the index is part of a constraint. If you want to drop the index, for instance, you must drop the constraint.
