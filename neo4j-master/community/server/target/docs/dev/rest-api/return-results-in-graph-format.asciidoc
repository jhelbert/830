=== Return results in graph format ===

If you want to understand the graph structure of nodes and relationships returned by your query,
you can specify the "graph" results data format. For example, this is useful when you want to visualise the
graph structure. The format collates all the nodes and relationships from all columns of the result,
and also flattens collections of nodes and relationships, including paths.
